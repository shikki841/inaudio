## Speak. Edit. Keep going.

- Dictate with a keyboard shortcut and keep a searchable transcript history.
- Read text or your clipboard aloud with on-device speech synthesis.
- Manage speech models, microphone settings, and playback in one desktop app.

Download a model once, then run inference locally. Model downloads need an internet connection. Desktop packages target Windows, macOS, and Linux; permissions and text insertion vary by platform. Production releases are signed and distributed through electron-builder update manifests; development and pull-request builds do not contact the update feed.

Speech-to-text includes NVIDIA Nemotron ASR Streaming, an English cache-aware streaming model with a 560 ms latency/accuracy profile. It runs through sherpa-onnx on the CPU after its verified model archive is downloaded; the model remains subject to the [NVIDIA Open Model License](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/agreements/enterprise-software/nvidia-open-model-license/).

## Run locally

Use Node.js 24 LTS and npm. Native packaging prerequisites are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shikki841/inaudio.git
cd inaudio
npm ci
npm start
```

```sh
npm run check   # TypeScript + ESLint
npm run package:release  # Build the electron-builder package for your current OS
```

Pick a model during setup and grant microphone access when prompted.
